        <h3>The Shinning</h3>
            <p>Big horror movie fan, this movie is by far on that really scared me
                the first time I watched it. Not a lot of violence or blood compared
                to the movies on the last few years, but a lot of scary partys.
            </p>
        <h3>The Green mile</h3>
            <p>A drama movie that really gets me in my feelings. A wrongly accused
                man is going to prison for murder, but his kindness and compassion 
                will change the life of many people.

        <h3>Aladdin</h3>
            A Disney's old classic! It was a movie I could watch multiple a week when
            I was younger, to the point of getting my parents annoyed.As an adult today,
            I still enjoy this movie a lot!
